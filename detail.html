                        Yemen faces its biggest crisis in decades with the overthrow of its government by the Houthis, a Zaydi Shiite movement, and the resulting offensive led by Saudi Arabia. 
                        <p>
                            The fighting, and a Saudi-imposed blockade ostensibly meant to enforce an arms embargo, has had devastating humanitarian consequences, causing more than one million people to become internally displaced and leading to cholera outbreaks, medicine shortages, and threats of famine. The United Nations calls the humanitarian crisis in Yemen “the worst in the world.”

            <h2>Syrian Civil War</h2>
            <div class="box-1">
                <h3>About:</h3>
                    <p>
                        A peaceful uprising against the president of Syria almost eight years ago turned into a full-scale civil war. The conflict has left more than 360,000 people dead, devastated cities and drawn in other countries.
                        <p>
                            Even before the conflict began, many Syrians were complaining about high unemployment, corruption and a lack of political freedom under President Bashar al-Assad, who succeeded his father, Hafez, after he died in 2000.

                        In March 2011, pro-democracy demonstrations erupted in the southern city of Deraa, inspired by the "Arab Spring" in neighbouring countries.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When the government used deadly force to crush the dissent, protests demanding the president's resignation erupted nationwide.

                        The unrest spread and the crackdown intensified. Opposition supporters took up arms, first to defend themselves and later to rid their areas of security forces. Mr Assad vowed to crush what he called "foreign-backed terrorism".

                        The violence rapidly escalated and the country descended into civil war.
                        </p>
                        
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        It is now more than a battle between those who are for or against Mr Assad.

                        Many groups and countries - each with their own agendas - are involved, making the situation far more complex and prolonging the fighting.

            <h2>Armed Conflict, Food Insecurity and Epidemics in Democratic Republic of Congo</h2>
            <div class="box-1">
                <h3>About:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is facing one of the longest-standing and most complex humanitarian crises in the world.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The country is simultaneously experiencing armed conflicts, food insecurity and recurring epidemics, including cholera, measles and the second-largest ever Ebola outbreak globally. Insecurity has led to large-scale forced displacement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gender-based violence (GBV) is endemic in the DRC. UNFPA leads the GBV sub-clusters in various parts of the country and coordinates the support that is provided to over 30,000 GBV survivors each year. Many more GBV cases remain unreported, however.
